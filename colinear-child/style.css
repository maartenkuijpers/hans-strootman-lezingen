Description: Colinear -- our update to the older Coraline -- is a squeaky-clean theme featuring a custom menu, header, background, and layout options. Colinear supports featured images and six widget areas -- up to three each in the sidebar and footer. Primarily designed for magazine-style sites, Colinear is a flexible theme that suits any personal blog, or content-rich site.
